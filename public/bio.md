My name is Dalton Claybrook and I'm a software developer. Thanks for checking out my site! üôÇ

I work for [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com) where I help build [Peloton Digital for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/peloton-digital/id792750948?mt=8). I spend most of my time improving the In-Class experience in the app. Ask me about `AVPlayer` and `HLS`! ‚èØ I'm also really into **RxSwift**, a topic I've [written](https://medium.com/@daltonclaybrook/rxswift-mvvm-a-little-at-a-time-81ac17dcf285) and [spoken](https://www.prolificinteractive.com/iosoho/#rxswift-in-practice) about.

This site is build with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Go**, and **Python**, and uses various services like **AWS S3**, **CloudFront**, and **CircleCI**. It's open-source, so feel free to [clone or fork on GitHub](https://github.com/daltonclaybrook/dalton-website).
